data sets: 
Highschooler ( ID, name, grade ) 
English: There is a high school student with unique ID and a given first name in a certain grade. 

Friend ( ID1, ID2 ) 
English: The student with ID1 is friends with the student with ID2. Friendship is mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Friend table, so is (456, 123). 

Likes ( ID1, ID2 ) 
English: The student with ID1 likes the student with ID2. Liking someone is not necessarily mutual, so if (123, 456) is in the Likes table, there is no guarantee that (456, 123) is also present. 

Q1: Find the names of all students who are friends with someone named Gabriel. 
Answer: 
select highschooler.name

from (select l1.ID1 as l1ID, l1.ID2 as l2ID
from likes l1) as L1 join (select l2.ID1 as l1ID, l2.ID2 as l2ID
from likes l2) as L2 join  highschooler h1 join  highschooler h2

inner join Highschooler
where ID = friendmerge.ID1
and friendmerge.ID1 not in (
select distinct ID1 
from (select ID1, ID2 from Friend) as friendmerge2 
join Highschooler H1
join Highschooler H2 
where friendmerge2.ID1=H1.ID
